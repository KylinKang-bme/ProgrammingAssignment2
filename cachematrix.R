## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    inv <<- NULL
    x <<- y
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(inp) inv <<- inp
  getSolve <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(m)
  m
}
